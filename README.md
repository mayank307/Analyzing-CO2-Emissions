# Analyzing-CO2-Emissions
Is climate change real? The world stands divided on this topic, primarily into two groups. One group is in favor and believes global warming is the cause behind it, while the other believes climate change is a hoax. The former group blames the emission of greenhouse gases like CO2 for the rise in global temperature. It is difficult to understand how fair it is to blame those emissions but can a data analyst help? Yes, explore the project idea to know how.

Project Idea: Download the sample dataset ‘fuelconsumption.csv’ and store it into a Pandas dataframe. Analyze the dataset using various functions for a dataframe object like df.head(), df.summary(), etc. Analyze the data using a logistic regression model and plot various graphs using the matplotlib library to draw various conclusions. As a challenge, try to estimate future values by splitting the dataset into test and training subsets.
